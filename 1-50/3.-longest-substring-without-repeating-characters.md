# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters



Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
* `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Answer:

### Python:

```text
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        char_in_substring = {}
        start = max_substring_len = 0
        for i, char in enumerate(s):
            if char in char_in_substring:
                if char_in_substring[char]>=start:
                    start = char_in_substring[char]+1
            substring_length = i - start + 1
            if substring_length>max_substring_len:
                max_substring_len = substring_length
            char_in_substring[char] = i
        return max_substring_len

```
